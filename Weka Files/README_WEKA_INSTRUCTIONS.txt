TO RUN WEKA ON FILES:
Go to https://github.com/ndarwich/Crash-Analysis and download the two .csv files (train_file and final-test-NEW). They will be needed to be converted into .arff files using WEKA (we put the arff files up on github initially but downloading them converts them into .txt thus making them unreadable by WEKA). To convert the csv files into .arff: start WEKA and click Tools then ArffViewer. A new window will open then click File and Open then navigate to the directory where the files are. Once in that directory, click Files of Type and the file type to CSV data files. The file will be loaded and now click File and Save As and then click Save. This must be done for both files.
